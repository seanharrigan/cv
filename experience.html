        Epidemiologist working in research and surveillance in COVID-19 related 
        projects for the UBC Centre for Disease Control (UBCCDC) and BC Centre 
        for Disease Control (BCCDC). Our work is focused on understanding how 
        SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern impact disease severity and health 
        outcomes using large administrative databases. We are also using 
        SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data to evaluate the impact of other emerging 
        variants. <br>

                - Leading the statistical analysis in R: this includes exploratory 
                analyses as well as creating data analysis pipelines from tidying raw 
                data, applying a causal framework to analysis and to modelling severity 
                outcomes.
