        <br>
        I am an epidemiologist working for the BCCDC and UBCCDC 
        in COVID-19 related research and surveillance projects. 
        My background includes various research roles related to
        health in academia, industry and volunteer positions, 
        with a focus in methodology, data / statistical analysis 
        and academic writing. Skilled in using scripting 
        languages for analysis, with in depth knowledge in R 
        and limited experience with SQL, Python and Bash.

        The Master's Program covered epidemiological study design and methodology, statistics 
        and data analysis in R, as well as elective courses in cancer epidemiology and 
        health economics. My <strong><a href="https://open.library.ubc.ca/soa/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0396872">thesis</a></strong> 
        thesis focused on the association between the built environment - 
        specifically air pollution, walkability and residential greenness - and breast cancer 
        risk in post-menopausal women in British Columbia using Cox proportional hazards modelling 
        within the British Columbia Generations Project Cohort.
